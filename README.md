A complete overhaul to Europa Universalis IV in which feudal Japan replaces the original map by Curious and StabShot.

This mod is modeled after the excellent (but somewhat laggy) ShatteredEuropa, as such it does not strive to be historically accurate. All it is is a fun and interesting map for everyone to play BlobSimulator [CURRENT_YEAR] on. ;)

Primarly designed for SwedditUniversalis' multiplayer sessions.

This repo holds some useful scripts for mod making as well.
