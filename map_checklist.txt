Checklist Map:

Completed:
Provinces.bmp
Terrain.bmp
world_normal.bmp
heightmap.bmp
continent.txt - don't think we want to split the map up in continents
provicegroup.txt - serves no use?
seasons.txt
terrain.txt - probably does not need terrain overrides defined?
superregion.txt - might need more superregions in it, but probably not
region.txt
tradegoods.bmp

Psuedo-complete:
default.map - needs sea_starts (and possible lakes) defined.
area.txt - sea tile areas need to be defined and named
definition.csv - is just missing names for all the provinces but passable atm.
trade_winds.txt - just left empty, no need for it?


To do:
climate.txt - needs to be properly split according to climate, and mountains possibly need to be added.
adjacencies.csv
(positions.txt)
colormap_x.DDS (Nvidia Texture Tools)
